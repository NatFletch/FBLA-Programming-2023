# Installation and usage

I realized that using Python and HTML sounds good on paper but unfortunately a lot of frameworks are limiting my capabilities so I decided to go back to plain old javascript. Therefore a new branch was created called "experimental" in case if I need to switch back. For context the reason why I started off trying Python is because I didn't know very much JS at the time but now I feel confident in using JS so I am switching to that.

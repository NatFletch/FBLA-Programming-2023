# FBLA-Programming-2023
My programming project for the 2023 FBLA season.

See https://www.fbla-pbl.org/fbla-topics/ on the "Coding And Programming" tab for info on the guidelines for this project and any constraints.

# Installation and usage
 - Clone via git
 ```https://github.com/NatFletch/FBLA-Programming-2023.git```
 - Download and install Node.js
 - CD into source directory
 - Run `npm install` to install all neccessary project dependencies
 - Run `git checkout experimental` to switch to this branch
 - Start the program via `npm start`

## What is this branch???
Experimental branch is where I put all the major changes to my code. It's so I can save the `master` branch as a backup in case if I ever want to switch back and things become too chaotic in the on going experiment. An example is when I switched out the entire backend language from Python to Javascript.

## Current Experiment:
Currently there are no current on going experiments. This branch will remain inactive until a new experiment comes along (there will be a new one in the foreseeable future.)

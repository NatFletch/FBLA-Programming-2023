# FBLA-Programming-2023
My programming project for the 2023 FBLA season. 

See https://www.fbla-pbl.org/fbla-topics/ on the "Coding And Programming" tab for info on the guidelines for this project and any constraints.

# Installation and usage
- Programmed in Python (minimum version unknown right now) and potentially Electron soon (HTML, CSS, and JS) for the frontend of the application
- Coming soon because I might be changing how the frontend will work

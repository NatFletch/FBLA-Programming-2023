# FBLA-Programming-2023
My programming project for the 2023 FBLA season.

See https://www.fbla-pbl.org/fbla-topics/ on the "Coding And Programming" tab for info on the guidelines for this project and any constraints.

# Installation and usage
(not recommended because this is an archive branch)
 - Clone via git
 ```https://github.com/NatFletch/FBLA-Programming-2023.git```
 - Download and install Node.js
 - CD into source directory
 - Run `npm install` to install all neccessary project dependencies
 - Run `git checkout pyscript-archive` to switch to this branch
 - Start the program via `npm start`


## What is this branch???
Pyscript archive is a milestone for when I turned from using pyscript as the backend (a `<script>` tag but it runs python.) I quit pyscript because it had a long loading time, it was unecessary, and its usage was way too similar to javascript so I ended up opting for javascript instead.
